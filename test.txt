New Bank banking system
----------------------
Oracle DB has not been as good as expected for core banking. We need to create new banking system in Java!

Your good colleague has written (before his leave for vacation) an interface and unit tests, so it will be easy for you to continue.
Implement new functionality to satisfy NewBankTest unit test.

There are given accounts and transactions between them (BankDataFactory). Bank system is set up by call setAccounts and setTransactions.
Set of accounts in the system is final and won't change during runtime. Transaction count can increase.

1) Implement getBalance() in NewBank class
     - finds out actual balance for given account.

2) Implement processTransaction() in NewBank class
     - process new transaction during runtime.

2) Implement getSumAmounts() in NewBank class
     - finds out total amount of all transactions in the system.

3) Implement getAccount(String) in NewBank class
     - Finds account object.

4) Write unit tests for getAccount.

5) [BONUS] Create new method getTransactions(String name) in IBank and implement it.
     - Returns all transactions for given account name (account is either source or target account).

- You can find more details in IBank interface.
- Do your best in all areas of expertise - code, object orientation, tests, documentation, etc.
- Feel free to modify all files including interfaces (except existing unit tests and test data).
- You can create as many new files (classes, interfaces, ...) as you want.


Good luck. Release to production is in 60 minutes.
